Hi Ms. Inderjeit :D
<br><br>
Happy Teacher's Appreciation Week!!! 
<br><br>
Thank you for being a nice and fun teacher throughout the school year. It's been very fun having you as my English teacher!!  While your expectations of us are high, you make our classes fun and something to look forward to. As to where I never liked English classes much, you seem to make it fun enough for me to put my best self forward. You've been one of the best teacher I ever had, both personality-wise and teaching-wise. Thank you for showing me a new love for reading. Iâ€™ve found a lot of books I like to read because of you, so thank you! I feel like I've learned a lot during the time I've been in your class, pertaining both to school and outside matters as well. For this I thank you, and I hope you have a good Teacher's Appreciation Week :)

Thank you for being such a good teacher!! (and also for the snacks !! :D)
